    @ Work Flow
        | In the client.c we parse each command from stdin and compute using
        | methods describes in @utils/request.c GET/POST/DELETE HTTP requests
        | to the server.
        |
        | The body of the messages send/received are firstly validated by 
        | searching for an ERROR message using methods described in
        | @parser/message_parser.c. Then, we compute JSON format using
        | JSON formatting methods in @parser/json_parser.c
        |
        | In @parser/message_parser.c we retrieve from LOGIN command and
        | ENTER_LIBRARY command the token and the cookie for the 
        | corresponding session. Then, send the cookie and the authorization
        | to the server.
        |
        | In case of an ERROR the server sends an error message and
        | we retrieve it and print its content to stdout.
        | Possible ERRORS are: not being connected to the server,
        | not having the authorization to the library, bad credentials,
        | not being logged in.

        | For parsing requests and buffer formatting I 
        | used the sources from PCom Laborator 10:
